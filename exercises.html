			  Lie down and lift the dumbells above your head, pause for 1 second before lowering back dwon slowly, until 
			  dumbells are level with your head.
			</p>
			<h3>Dips</h3>
			<p>
		      Find 2 parellel bars and grab. Begin to hover whilst holding onto the bars. Push yourself up and as you do
			  this lean in slightly so you can feel the emphasis on your chest. As you get to the top lower yourself back 
			  down slowly.
		   </p>

           <h3>Bent over row</h3>
		    <p>
		      Walk up to a barbell that is on the floor. Use just your legs to lower yourself and grab the bar. Pull the bar
			  against your lower chest while keeping your torso horizontal. Return the bar to the floor on each rep.
			</p>
		   <h3>Pull-up</h3>
			<p>
		      Walk up to standard bar.  Grab it with both hands with them being shoudler width apart. A true pull up should always

           <h3>Sprinting</h3>
		    <p>
		      Accelerate as fast as you can with your legs. Remember to push off with your back foot to generate more force.
			  As you are in full flow of sprinting, sway your arms bac and fourth. This will generate even more force allowing 
			  you to prolong the action that has been taken.
			</p>
		   <h3>Squat</h3>
			<p>
		      Approach a Squat rack already loaded up with a considerable amount of weight you can lift. Begin ducking under the 
			  bar and placing the barbell on your shoulders. Grab the bar with the palm of your hands and lift up. When you in the
			  starting position lower yourself until your bottom gets to hip height.

		  <h1>Full body vs Splits</h1>
		   <dl>
              <dt><b>Full body</b></dt>
                 <dd>Both methods work can work equally aswell. A full body workout is definetely the right way to go if you are a beginner and you wan to build muscle
				 fast. If they are done properly and consistently it would normally take around 2 months to achieve to start to see results. 
				 </dd>
				 <dd>
				 The reason they are so effective as they can be performed throrughout the week without tiring out your muscles to much. These full body workout can normally be perfomed
				 at a rate of 3 times a week. As a beginner you will develop muscle very quickly because you are just starting out and literally any weight that you pick up
				 will make you notice results.</dd>
              <dt><b>Splits</b></dt>
                 <dd>With splits, these are not something that should be considered by th beginner because its just not that beneficial. But for who it is beneficial for is 
				 people that have experience behind the weights already possible someone that had been working out around 6 months to a year.
				 </dd>
				 <dd>
				 There will come a time when you will start to plateau with full body workouts and therefore you will not progress any further. To outbreak this splits are great
				 for this as it allows you to break down your muscle far more effectively than what a full body workout would bring. Also Having a weeks rest thorughout the week will 
				 allow your muscles to recover and give them the rest and time to recover. 
				 </dd>
