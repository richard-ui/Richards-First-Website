		<h1 id="heading">Exercises</h1>
		<h1>Train equally and powerful!</h1>
		
		    <p>
		      The chest, the back and the legs are the main muscles that you notice when you look at the human body and so in order to add size to these then 
			  therefore they should be trained aggressivley to gain the best results as possible. 
			</p>
			<p>
			  Also all muscle groups should be trained equally to each other whether
			  that be all in one workout or split up thorughout the week you want to make sure you balance it out providing you hit your muscles with the same intensity 
			  as the previous exercise you did. A lways give 100% everytime!
		    </p>
		<h1>Compund exercises</h1>
		   <p>
		      Compound exercises are exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once. These are the best for muscle growth as they provide more resistance
			  and can break down the muscle more. They also incrase your human groth hormone which will in turn increase metabolism and also
			  build muscle. For example a bench press would significantly take precedence over the isolation exercises. 
			</p>
            <p>			
			  Isolation exercises include the tricep push down and
              the bicep curl for example. These exercises can be ok but are mostly considered average by a lot of fitnesss fanaticts. They can be beneficial but
              often then are just used to shape the muscle and always should be done at the end of a workout after you have 
              used up most of your energy performing the compound exercises.
