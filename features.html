			<h1>Good reasons to Exercise</h1>
			 <ul>
			      <li>
				    <h3>Exercise makes you happy!</h3>
					
					    <p>When exercising, your brain gives off this great aura of self-esteem which makes you happier
					       and more relaxed. This is great because it can make you feel less stressed out taking away all them 
					       little problems of your day to day life by focusing on something that motivates ourselves significantly.
						</p>
						
					
				  </li>

			      <li>
				    <h3>Build Aerobic Power.</h3>
					    <p>Performing steady state cardio increases your aerobic capacity and if you perform it consistently you will 
					       look and feel fitter for all the more doind so. It increases endurance and it will allow you to perform daily tasks 
					       on a day-to-day basis. It will increase your V02 max capacity which will allow to go longer and harder when exercising.
					    </p>
				  </li>
				  <hr>
				  <li>
				    <h3>Builds and Preserves Muscle mass.</h3>
					    <p>
			               Yes that right exercise can increase muscle mass. Depending on which exercise you are doing then you will 
						   build muscle in that certain area. Such as the leg press will build muscle and the basic push up will build chest
						   and tricep muscle. But exercising is only one thing to consider when trying to build muslce size/mass as you will
						   need to consume more calories that your body may need each day. To be in a caloric surplus

		     <p>
		        Muscle are not made in the gym unless you stick to a strict diet. An unhealthy diet would be bad on your body and you will not see results if you are
		        throwing garbage down your mouth every second. Even if you dont eat as much but you are still eating them unprocessed foods, this will be still considered
		        unhealthy due to the fact most unprocessed foods are high in calories. Bad foods include startchy carb foods such as cookies, pizza and chips. 
		        Also they can have a reverse effect on your body causing your body to have low metabolism low concentration, possible diabetes etc.
		        To maintain a healthy diet stick to low to average calorie dense foods and also consume plenty of protein. This is the nutrient that is used to build the 
		        muscle so consume it wisely.
